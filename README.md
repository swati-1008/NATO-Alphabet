# NATO-Alphabet

The NATO Alphabet repositroy deals with the problem of spelling out words on a telephone. Many-a-times, the receiver cannot understand the letters to be used in the word spelled out by the speaker. It needs out to be spelled like 'A' for Alfa, 'B' for Bravo, and so on. In such cases it may happen that 'P' for Pneumonia may come to speaker's mind, and it becomes difficult for the receiver to understand the letter. The NATO Phonetic Alphabet hence comes to the rescue to tell all the references for each letter.

The user just enters a word, and this project will tell the referenced words. For instance, if the user inputs the word 'Swati', the output of this project will be ['Sierra', 'Whiskey', 'Alfa', 'Tango', 'India']
